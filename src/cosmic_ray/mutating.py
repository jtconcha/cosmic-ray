    """Apply a sequence of mutations, run thest tests, and reports the results.

    This is fundamentally the mutation(s)-and-test-run implementation at the heart of Cosmic Ray.

    There are three high-level ways that a worker can finish. First, it could fail exceptionally, meaning that some
    uncaught exception made its way from some part of the operation to terminate the function. This function will
    intercept all exceptions and return it in a non-exceptional structure.

    Second, the mutation machinery may determines that - for any of the mutations - there is no mutation to be made (e.g.
    the 'occurrence' is too high).  In this case there is no way to report a test result (i.e. killed, survived, or
    incompetent) so a special value is returned indicating that no mutation is possible.

    Finally, and hopefully normally, the worker will find that it can run a test. It will do so and report back the
    result - killed, survived, or incompetent - in a structured way.

    Args:
        mutations: An iterable of ``MutationSpec``\\s describing the mutations to make.
        test_command: The command to execute to run the tests
        timeout: The maximum amount of time (seconds) to let the tests run

    Returns:
        A ``WorkResult``.

    Raises:
        This will generally not raise any exceptions. Rather, exceptions will be reported using the 'exception'
        result-type in the return value.
